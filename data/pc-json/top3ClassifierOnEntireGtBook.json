		"promptString" : "The Glamorous Toolkit (GT) Book consists of over 500 notebook pages documenting various aspects of Moldable Development and the GT IDE that supports it.\n\nA typical newcomer to GT is either:\n(i) someone who has heard of GT, and would like to learn more about it, but has no particular  goal in mind, or\n(ii) someone with a specific problem to solve, whether work-related or a personal hobby project.\nWe want to provide newcomers with a roadmap of the pages organized around a set of 20-30 GT-related topics.\n\nA good topic is high-level enough that we can assign multiple pages to a topic, but specific enough to be useful for finding relevant pages.\n\nExamples of good topics:\n- Understanding Moldable Development -- a baseline for a newcomer to build on.\n- Programming Smalltalk -- something a newcomer needs to learn.\n- Working with Python -- many newcomers have Python code bases.\n- Moldable Development Patterns -- patterns offer a good way to explain moldable development, and they cross cut many tutorials and case studies.\n- Reflection and Metaprogramming -- moldable development is about building lots of little tools, so many pages touch on reflective techniques and metaprogramming.\n\nExamples of poor topics:\n- Working with GraphSQL -- too specific for a cluster of pages.\n- Glamorous Toolkit -- too broad; all the pages relate to GT.\n- Method Wrappers -- too specific; this is just one particular reflective technique.\n\nYour job is to assign topics to a given page, so that pages can be organized into clusters by topic.\nTry to select good topics that can be used to effectively cluster pages.\nEach page will cover at least one topic, but possible more, as topics cross-cut multiple dimensions.\nPlease provide only a single topic per page, unless the page clearly covers more than one topic, in which case a maximum of three topics may be listed.\nJust list the topics and do not provide any further explanations.\n"
