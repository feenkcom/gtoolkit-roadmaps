		"promptString" : "The Glamorous Toolkit (GT) Book consists of over 500 notebook pages documenting various aspects of Moldable Development and the GT IDE that supports it.\n\nA typical newcomer to GT is either:\n(i) someone who has heard of GT, and would like to learn more about it, but has no particular  goal in mind, or\n(ii) someone with a specific problem to solve, whether work-related or a personal hobby project.\nWe want to provide newcomers with a roadmap of the pages organized around a set of GT-related topics.\n\nThe topic of a page refers to its subject matter, for example, \"Using Bloc\", or Programming Smalltalk\", not the style or format of the page, such as \"Tutorial\" or \"FAQ\".\n\nA good topic is high-level enough that we can assign multiple pages to a topic, but specific enough to be useful for finding relevant pages.\n\nYour job is to assign topics from a curated list to a given page, so that pages can be organized into clusters by topic. Each page will cover at least one topic, but possible more, as topics cross-cut multiple dimensions. Please provide only a single topic per page, unless the page clearly covers more than one topic, in which case a maximum of five topics may be listed. You should only assign topics from the curated list, unless there is no topic that fits, in which case you may propose a topic not on the list. In your results, simply list the topics for the page and do not provide any further explanations.\n\nHere is the list of curated topics:\n\n```\nAbout Glamorous Toolkit\nAlgorithm Explanations\nAnnouncements and Event Handling\nAsynchronous Programming\nBook Organization and Navigation\nBuilding Custom Tools\nCode Analysis\nCode Configuration and Package Management\nCollections and Data Structures\nCommunity & Support\nDebugging in Glamorous Toolkit\nDeployment and Persistence\nDistributed and Remote Execution\nDomain Modeling\nExamples and Documentation\nExplainable Systems\nExtension Methods\nGames and Simulations in Glamorous Toolkit\nGetting Started with GT\nGT Component Documentation\nInspector actions\nInspector Views\nLive Documentation\nMoldable Development Practices\nMoldable Exceptions\nObject-Oriented Programming Concepts\nParsing and Language Manipulation\nPerformance Analysis and Profiling\nPharo Integration and Compatibility\nPragmas and Annotations\nProgramming Smalltalk\nQuerying and Navigating Code\nRecovering from Crashes\nReflection and Metaprogramming\nScripting and Automation\nSecurity and Authentication\nSmalltalk History\nText Editing\nUsing Beacon\nUsing Bloc\nUsing Coder\nUsing Lepiter\nUsing Metacello\nUsing Mondrian\nUsing PetitParser\nUsing SmaCC\nUtilities and Extensions\nWardley Maps\nWorking with Baselines and Dependencies\nWorking with Bash\nWorking with Cobol\nWorking with External APIs\nWorking with External Data\nWorking with External Tools\nWorking with GemStone\nWorking with Git and GitHub\nWorking with Java\nWorking with JavaScript\nWorking with Legacy Languages\nWorking with LLMs\nWorking with Python\nWorking with React and React Native\nWorking with Rust\nWorking with the File System\n```"
